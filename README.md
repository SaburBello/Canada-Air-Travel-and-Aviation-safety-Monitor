# Canadian Aviation Sector Performance Analysis (2015-2023)

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the Canadian aviation sector's performance from 2015 to 2023. The analysis utilizes data from Statistics Canada and focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide insights into passenger volumes, revenue, travel patterns, and regional contributions. The dashboard reveals significant insights into Canadian air travel patterns and infrastructure performance. [cite: 1] A notable disruption occurred in 2020-2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [cite: 4] While passenger numbers have shown strong recovery towards pre-pandemic levels, revenue per passenger has remained notably elevated compared to 2019 levels, suggesting a structural shift in pricing or service mix. [cite: 5]

## Key Findings

* **Passenger Volume and Revenue:** Total passenger volume is 684,607, with an average load factor of 76.98% and revenue per passenger of $38,374.92. [cite: 2]
* **Domestic vs. International Travel:** Passenger distribution shows a near-equal split between domestic (48.12%) and international (51.88%) travelers, indicating strong international connectivity. [cite: 3]
* **Shift in International Travel:** A significant shift is observed in international travel patterns: US-bound air returns surpassed non-US international returns in 2022-2023, reversing the pre-pandemic trend where non-US international travel dominated. [cite: 6, 7] This marks a fundamental change in international travel dynamics. [cite: 7]
* **Revenue Per Passenger:** While passenger volumes recovered to near pre-pandemic levels, revenue per passenger remains significantly elevated compared to 2019, indicating sustained higher pricing in the aviation market. [cite: 10]
* **Regional Contributions:** British Columbia and Ontario are key drivers of itinerant air travel in Canada. [cite: 9]
* **Airport Activity vs. Incidents:** Quebec has less airport activity than both Ontario and British Columbia but has more serious incidents taking place there. [cite: 12, 13]

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data from the following sources:

* Operating and financial statistics for major Canadian airlines, monthly (2014-2024) [cite: 7, 8]
* International travelers entering or returning to Canada, by type of transportation and traveler type [cite: 7, 8]
* Domestic and international itinerant movements, by geography, airports with NAV CANADA services and other selected airports, monthly [cite: 7, 8]
* Surveys and statistical programs - Screened traffic at Canadian airports [cite: 7, 8]

## Methodology

The analysis employs a variety of methodologies to derive insights:

* Pie chart segmentation for domestic vs. international passenger distribution [cite: 7]
* Time series analysis (2014-2024) tracking revenue per passenger against passenger volumes [cite: 7]
* Comparative bar chart analysis showing the shift in US vs. non-US international travel patterns [cite: 7]
* Geographic visualization highlighting regional travel contributions [cite: 7]
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for top-level metrics [cite: 7]
